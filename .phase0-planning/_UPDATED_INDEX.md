## Critical Facts at a Glance

### Phase 0 Completion Status
- **25-30% complete** (not 80% as previously believed)
- Architecture: **90% designed**
- Implementation: **~5% complete** (traits only)
- Build status: **36+ compilation errors**

### What's Working ✅
- Excellent service layer architecture (9/10)
- Comprehensive trait definitions
- Language support (20+ via tree-sitter)
- Commercial boundary protection
- Type system preserves ast-grep power

### What's Missing ❌
- AstGrepParser implementation (**CRITICAL**)
- AstGrepAnalyzer implementation (**CRITICAL**)
- Mock implementations for testing
- Metadata extraction logic
- Cross-file analysis system
- Contract/integration tests
- Workspace build completion

### The Decision Point (Now)
- **Path A**: Complete services-only (24-28 days)
- **Path B**: Services + CocoIndex dataflow (35-42 days)
- **Path C (Recommended)**: Hybrid prototype both (3 weeks), decide with evidence
- **Timeline**: Decision by January 30, 2026
