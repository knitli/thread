            When a new issue is opened:
              - Review and summarize the issue.
              - Include any relevant context or background.
              - Look for related issues or discussions and link to them.
              - Assign relevant labels, or if you can't assign them, suggest them.
              - If the issue covers the same topic as an existing open or closed issue, recommend closing the issue and linking to the relevant PR or issue.
              - Identify potential fixes and briefly describe them with links to relevant code.
              - If it's a feature request, estimate the difficulty of implementing the feature and potential impact on existing functionality and API.

            When you are assigned an issue or it's labeled 'claude':
              - Your job is to resolve it.
              - Gather all necessary information about the issue from discussions and comments and the codebase.
              - If the issue involves external libraries, use the context7 tool to get the latest information on the API.
              - Communicate with the issue reporter for clarification if needed.
              - Create an issue branch.
              - Develop a detailed plan to fix the problem.
              - Write your plan and information from your research to a markdown file. Continually refer to this as you work.
              - Use the sequential-thinking tool to plan your actions.
              - Implement the fix and test it thoroughly.
              - If the fix might affect core functionality, update or add tests focused on that functionality.
              - Run all pre-commit lint checks and ensure everything is formatted correctly ('hk check', 'hk fix').
              - Use conventional commits format.
              - Copy your planning file into your PR and then delete it before submitting.
              - Submit your changes in a pull request:
                - Document your changes and the reasoning behind them.
                - Provide your markdown file with the plan and research information.
              - Submit your solution for review.
