[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/git.fsfe.org/reuse/api)](https://api.reuse.software/info/git.fsfe.org/reuse/api)

## License

### Thread

Thread is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0-or-later). You can find the full license text in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file. You can use Thread for free, for personal and commercial use, you can also change the code however you like, but **you must share your changes with the community** under the AGPL 3.0 or later. You must also include the AGPL 3.0 with any copies of Thread you share. Copies must also include the copyright notice. Knitli Inc. is the creator and copyright holder of Thread.

If you're not familiar with the AGPL 3.0, the important parts are:

- You can use Thread for free, for personal and commercial use.
- You can change the code however you like.
- You must share your changes with the community under the AGPL 3.0 or later. This includes the source for any changes you make, along with that of any larger work you create that includes Thread.
- If you don't make any changes to Thread, you can use it without sharing your source code.
- You must include the AGPL 3.0 and Knitli's copyright notice with any copies of Thread you share. We recommend using the [SPDX specification](https://spdx.dev/learn/handling-license-info/)

### Want to use Thread in a closed source project?

**If you want to use Thread in a closed source project, you can purchase a commercial license from Knitli**. This allows you to use Thread without sharing your source code. Please contact us at [licensing@knit.li](mailto:licensing@knit.li)

### Other Licenses

While most of Thread is licensed under the AGPL 3.0, there are some exceptions:

- The `thread-ast-grep` and `thread-languages` crates are licensed under the MIT license (even the languages we've added). These crates are heavily based on parts of the wonderful [ast-grep](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep) project, which is also licensed under the MIT license. We are grateful for their work and contributions to the open source community, and felt it best to keep these crates under the same license. We couldn't have built Thread without the foundation Ast-Grep provided.
- Unless otherwise noted, documentation and configuration files are licensed under either the MIT license or the Apache License 2.0. This includes the `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTORS_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md`, and other similar files. This allows for more flexibility in how these files can be used and shared.
- All other files in the repository are licensed under the AGPL 3.0 or later.

### Contributing

We love contributions of any kind! By contributing to Thread, you agree to our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CONTRIBUTORS_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). This agreement ensures that we can continue to develop and maintain Thread while giving you credit for your contributions.

#### We Use Reuse

If you're in doubt, look at the top of the file, or look for a `.license` file with the same name as the file (like `Cargo.lock.license`). We follow the [Reuse Specification](https://reuse.software/) for license information in our codebase, which means every single file should have license information.
