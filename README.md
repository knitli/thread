# thread

High-performance code analysis and parsing engine powered by tree-sitter.

## 🚧 Development Status

This crate is currently under active development. This initial release serves as a placeholder to claim the crate name. The API is not yet stable and will change significantly in upcoming versions.

## 🎯 Planned Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Tree-sitter based parsing for Rust, Python, TypeScript, and more
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Efficient deduplication and versioning of code elements
- **High Performance**: Concurrent processing optimized for speed# thread

## 🚧 Development Status

This crate is currently under active development. This initial release serves as a placeholder to claim the crate name. The API is not yet stable and will change significantly in upcoming versions.

## 🎯 Planned Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Tree-sitter based parsing for Rust, Python, TypeScript, and more
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Efficient deduplication and versioning of code elements
- **High Performance**: Concurrent processing optimized for speed
- **WASM Ready**: Compile to WebAssembly for edge deployment
- **Incremental Parsing**: Live updates for language server capabilities
- **Query System**: Flexible, language-agnostic code element extraction

## 🏗️ Architecture

Thread will be built as a modular workspace:

- `thread-core` - Core traits and types
- `thread-parser` - High-performance parsing engine
- `thread-query` - Query system for code extraction
- `thread-languages` - Language-specific implementations
- `thread-wasm` - WebAssembly bindings
- `thread-cli` - Command-line interface
